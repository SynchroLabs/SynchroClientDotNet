=================================================


Controls -

    Implemented 
    ======================================

    !!! TODO - 

    Table (aka Grid, like HTML table, rows/colums, typically not data bound)

        Win/WinPhone - Grid
        Android - 
            TableLayout ?
            GridLayout - http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/11/new-layout-widgets-space-and-gridlayout.html
                Requires v11 (4.0/ICS) or v7 support library
        iOS - Ouch!

    WrapPanel

        Win/WinPhone - WrapPanel
        Android - FlowLayout - from here: http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/comment/156
            Also - http://slodge.blogspot.no/2013/01/an-mono-for-android-wrappanelflowlayout.html
        iOS -  UICollectionViewFlowLayout?

    GridView (flowing, scrolling grid) - Ideally support either data bound or explicit contents
        Win/WinPhone/Android - GridView
        iOS - UICollectionViewFlowLayout

        Attributes:
            item
            selectionItem

        Bindings:
            items
            selection
            onItemClick (command)

    !!! A GridView is really just a WrapPanel where every item is the same size.  Review use cases and functionality of platform
        controls and see if we can combine this into a single concept/implementation.



    Not Implemented Yet
    ========================

        !!! Survey controls on all platforms to make complete list (especially Android/iOS)

	    Checkbox/radio buttons

	    Date/time

	    Flip view

	    Flyout (not really a control)

	    Grid / VariableSizeWrapGrid (child elements have row/col properties)

		    { type: "grid", columns: [100, 100], rows: [50, 50], contents: [
		        { type: "text", value: "Somevalue", row: 1, column: 1 },
		    ] };

	    GridView

	    Hub

	    Media

	    Progress bar

	    Progress ring

	    Semantic zoom

	    Windows contracts?  Sharing, settings, search...

        Stepper (up/down)
            iOS - UIStepper
            No other platform has a control / standard (just use side-by-side buttons of appropriate style)


Client


    Transaction synchronization, "waiting" indicator (if > .5 seconds maybe), retry if fails?

    Set icon, title, supported orientation (maybe dynamic - only portrait on phone, only landscape on tab?)
    Deploy on all devices for demo

    Store/restore state as required (should just be client cookie/id and current page so can re-load as needed)
        - Requires persistent client state mechanism on server

    Look at perf (especially on iOS - maybe just related to console logging)
	    - Much better when not debugging

    Investigate initial image load issue on Android (DNS failure?), WinPhone (sim only?)

    View/resource caching

    WebSocket support on WinPhone

Server

    Test on iPad, Android tab (Nexus 7, Kindle Fire)

    Implement PropertyCross

Misc

    Separate binding ability of ARGB elements would be a neat parlor trick (maybe later)

    List stuff
        Need to make sure list element lifecycle is properly managed (that bound children are removed)
        Need to recycle views on platforms that support it (future?)
        Android is too agressive about recycling (maybe) - in propery cross list images load as scrolled (even ones previously loaded)

    Custom font names (platform-specific), weights (other than bold, per platform)?

================================================================================

Margin/Padding layout stuff
------------------------------------

Win/WinPhone

    http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms751709(v=vs.110).aspx

    Margin - Supported on all elements via Margin property and Margin.Left/Right/Top/Bottom for setting individual values
    Padding - Only supported on certain elements (Block, Border, Control, Textblock)

    To add padding to StackPanel, we put a StackPanel inside of a Border - tested and working

Android

    http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html

    Padding - Supported by all elements (views) via PaddingLeft/PaddingRight/PaddingTop/PaddingBottom properties
    Margin - Supported in children of ViewGroup elements via ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams

    Margin and padding tested and working in StackPanel and Border

iOS

    Margin and padding tested and working in StackPanel and Border (implemented from scratch)

    !!! Padding for controls that support it natively via ContentInset/ContentEdgeInset?  Override padding properties in derived control wrappers?

Summary:

	Every control supports margin, and Border/StackPanel (at least) obey them
    Border and StackPanel support padding 

=======================

Device features
   Location
   Photo picker / camera
   Maps
   Phone/SMS (?)
   "Built-in" apps - FB/Twitter/etc

=======================

Misc
-------
Scroll to top of page on transition (Windows, at least)
Default margin (all)
Control sizing when not specified (especially iOS/Android) - review

Text - if width specified and height not specified, should wrap, grow vertically, as required
   - What if width unspecified or star, but control is still constrained horizontally at some width by parent, how do we detect/handle that?
   - If height is wrap, then on layout, size to height (relayout if height changes)?

Image control 
    height and width attributes dertermine display size (as normal for control)
	Scaling mode (all support: none, fit, fill, stretch)
	   Also would be nice for layout to synthesize: fit-height, fit-width (and combine with "wrap" semantic for auto-sizing on opposite dimension)
	Scaling factor?
	Alignment of image?
	   H align for none, fit (and fit-height if supported)
	   V align for none, fit (and fit-width if supported)

	How does wrap sizing work with this?

	Example: 
	    Image scale fit-to-width, image height is unspecified ("wrap" height should be based on scaled height)

=========================================

Min/max height/width
  Win/WinPhone - supported
  Android - only min supported (not sure how hard max would be to add)
  iOS - Neither supported, but new sizing code should make it fairly straightforward

=========================================

Make demo apps not suck on iOS (default control margin/padding/spacing/alignment seems to be the main issue)

==========================================
New icon and splash screen (as appropriate) - All platforms
Deploy to all platforms
Use new icon image and complimentary border on Menu page
Make menu page data-driven (for each)
New icon for image page?
New icon on web site?
Push updated samples to Maaas.io

==========================================

Priority: min, max, value

result = min;
if (value > min)
{
    result = value;
	if (max > min)
	{
	    if (value > max)
		{
		    result = value;
		}
	}
}

If max >= min:
    min(max(val, min), max)
