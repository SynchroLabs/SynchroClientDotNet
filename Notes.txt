Mobile Application As A Service (MAAAS)
==============================================

Nomenclature - 
    BoundItems -> ViewModel (?)
    Request "state" -> context (?)

Processing view model changes on client:

    Apply add/remove differences

    Rebinding to connect to new/changed data

    Suspend change notification, update all changes, process bindings for all changes (look at tree for each)

	For array bindings, update repeated items (remove all and re-add?), use stored template to create items

Client side dynamic binding - example: slider bound to fontsize, only sync to server on command (if that)

	On control value change - use ValueBinding to update view model, and also to trigger synchronization (based on binding config)

Binding value types - currently all string, need to support boolean (and numeric?)
    In the special case that an attribute string contains a single binding, such as visibility="{isVisible}"
	Negation using !, such as visibility="{!isVisible}"

Binding expression support

    Mathematical (240 - charCount)
	Logical (charCount >= 240)
	Type conversion (str(240 - charCount))
