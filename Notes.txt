    Implemented 
    ======================================

    !!! All - document binding details, all supported attributes (specify which ones can use binding tokens), show sample usage

    !!! TODO - 

    Table (aka Grid, like HTML table, rows/colums, typically not data bound)

        Win/WinPhone - Grid
        Android - 
            TableLayout ?
            GridLayout - http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/11/new-layout-widgets-space-and-gridlayout.html
                Requires v11 (4.0/ICS) or v7 support library
        iOS - Ouch!

    WrapPanel

        Win/WinPhone - WrapPanel
        Android - FlowLayout - from here: http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/comment/156
            Also - http://slodge.blogspot.no/2013/01/an-mono-for-android-wrappanelflowlayout.html
        iOS -  UICollectionViewFlowLayout?

    GridView (flowing, scrolling grid) - Ideally support either data bound or explicit contents
        Win/WinPhone/Android - GridView
        iOS - UICollectionViewFlowLayout

        Attributes:
            item
            selectionItem

        Bindings:
            items
            selection
            onItemClick (command)

    !!! A GridView is really just a WrapPanel where every item is the same size.  Review use cases and functionality of platform
        controls and see if we can combine this into a single concept/implementation.



    Not Implemented Yet
    ========================

        !!! Survey controls on all platforms to make complete list (especially Android/iOS)

	    Checkbox/radio buttons

	    Date/time

	    Flip view

	    Flyout (not really a control)

	    Grid / VariableSizeWrapGrid (child elements have row/col properties)

		    { type: "grid", columns: [100, 100], rows: [50, 50], contents: [
		        { type: "text", value: "Somevalue", row: 1, column: 1 },
		    ] };

	    GridView

	    Hub

	    Media

	    Progress bar

	    Progress ring

	    Semantic zoom

	    Windows contracts?  Sharing, settings, search...

        Stepper (up/down)
            iOS - UIStepper
            No other platform has a control / standard (just use side-by-side buttons of appropriate style)


Client

    Configuration of server on client, maybe menu of servers so you can pick one as top level screen
       - Enter via address, get server identifier from server and use that in menu (maybe in addition to address)

       Launcher screen, comes up on startup - has Maaas.io name/logo
       List of Apps with add/remove
       On add - prompt for server address, connect to that server to get info, add to app list using info from server
          Endpoint: maaas.io, App: demo
          Endpoint: 127.0.0.1, App: demo (sandbox)
       Click app to launch (if fails or times out, back to launcher)


    Transaction synchronization, "waiting" indicator (if > .5 seconds maybe), retry if fails?

    Set icon, title, supported orientation (maybe dynamic - only portrait on phone, only landscape on tab?)
    Deploy on all devices for demo

    Store/restore state as required (should just be client cookie/id and current page so can re-load as needed)
        - Requires persistent client state mechanism on server

    Look at perf (especially on iOS - maybe just related to console logging)

    Investigate initial image load issue on Android (DNS failure?), WinPhone (sim only?)

    View/resource caching

    WebSocket support on WinPhone

Server

    Test on iPad, Android tab (Nexus 7, Kindle Fire)

    Persistent client state
        Use cookies?  homegrown cookie-like method?.  Needs to work with any driver.  
        Backed by Redis or similar, maybe Windows Azure Cache Services + db?
        New session
            Create session db entry, insert into cache, return session id
        On request start
            Get session from cache, if not in cache, look in db, if not in db, return "session not found" - trigger client to establish new session
            Otherwise record copy of session
        On request end
            Diff session, if changed, write updated session to db and cache

        Http needs to send session id on every request, websockets only when starting socket

    Cache
        View cache - negotiate view cache state so that server knows whether you need a given view or have it (to avoid round trips)?

    Hotloading (will need work on cluster deployment)

    Implement PropertyCross

Misc

    Separate binding ability of ARGB elements would be a neat parlor trick (maybe later)

    List stuff
        Need to make sure list element lifecycle is properly managed (that bound children are removed)
        Need to recycle views on platforms that support it (future?)
        Android is too agressive about recycling (maybe) - in propery cross list images load as scrolled (even ones previously loaded)

    Custom font names (platform-specific), weights (other than bold, per platform)?

================================================================================

Margin/Padding layout stuff
------------------------------------

Win/WinPhone

    http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms751709(v=vs.110).aspx

    Margin - Supported on all elements via Margin property and Margin.Left/Right/Top/Bottom for setting individual values
    Padding - Only supported on certain elements (Block, Border, Control, Textblock)

    To add padding to StackPanel, we put a StackPanel inside of a Border - tested and working

Android

    http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html

    Padding - Supported by all elements (views) via PaddingLeft/PaddingRight/PaddingTop/PaddingBottom properties
    Margin - Supported in children of ViewGroup elements via ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams

    Margin and padding tested and working in StackPanel and Border

iOS

    Margin and padding tested and working in StackPanel and Border (implemented from scratch)

    !!! Padding for controls that support it natively via ContentInset/ContentEdgeInset?  Override padding properties in derived control wrappers?

=======================

Everything should have margin, and Border/StackPanel (at least) should obey them
Border and StackPanel should have padding 

Containers

    ListView (can ignore margin/padding)
    StackPanel
    Border
    ScrollView
    Canvas (can ignore padding, child margins)


Dynamic sizing
    Win - 
        Layout logic - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms745058(v=vs.110).aspx
        FrameworkElement.MeasureOverride()

        FrameworkElement.Height/Width must be Double.NaN (which is the default) for autosizing to work
        FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment/VerticalAlignment must also be "Stretch" (which is the default), for autosizing to work

        In a panel with a single child, Double.NaN/Stretch works in either dimension (scrollview should be the same)
        In a stackpanel, with multiple children, autosizing only works perpendicular to the layout (so items in a vertical stack panel can
        auto-size to the width of the panel, but not the height, which kind of makes sense)

        For Grid: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.gridunittype(v=vs.110).aspx (GridLength/GridUnitType)

    Android - concept of "weight" (at least in some panels)

        No WrapPanel, but some comparable "FlowLayout" solutions: http://slodge.blogspot.no/2013/01/an-mono-for-android-wrappanelflowlayout.html

For each dimension, possible values:

    Wrap (default)
    Fill
    Explicit

    If Wrap or Fill, also consider:
        min
        max

    What about:
        star value means fill parent, unspecified means wrap content


=======================

Device features
   Location
   Photo picker / camera
   Maps
   Phone/SMS (?)
   "Built-in" apps - FB/Twitter/etc

=======================

Misc
-------
Scroll to top of page on transition (Windows, at least)
Default margin (all)
Control sizing when not specified (especially iOS/Android) - review
Text - if width specified and height not specified, should wrap, grow vertically, as required
Control sizing - fill to height/width, less margin?
