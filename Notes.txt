Mobile Application As A Service (MAAAS)
==============================================

Binding token directives - work on $parent (needs to get to the actual containing object context in one jump)

Command parameters

Navigation with parameters (passed to IntitialzeViewModelState?)

Rebinding

	If "resolved binding" (taking into consideration the binding context, which can include binding tokens) exists
	at the time of initial binding, a valid path can be constructed.  If not, this binding would have to be 
	re-attempted each time the client view model changes (from the server?) to see if the binding can then be
	established.  Do we really need to support that (binding contexts that aren't available in the initial state)?

        - What if a control binds to an item that is not present on the origina view model, but shows up later?
        - What if a control binds to an item on the view model, and that item goes away later?
	
	Investigate maintaining path/parentage on replaced tokens.
	How do binding tokens ($root, $parent, etc) fit in to this?

	For array bindings, update repeated items (remove all and re-add?), use stored template to create items (?)

On server 
    Persistent client state
        Use cookies?  homegrown cookie-like method?.  Needs to work with any driver.
    Cache
        View cache - negotiate view cache state so that server knows whether you need a given view or have it
    Hotloading (test for new, later will always load/hotload as needed)

Property binding expressions/directives:

	Negation using !, such as visibility="{!isVisible}"
	One time using ^

    Real expression support:

		Mathematical (240 - charCount)
		Logical (charCount >= 240)
		Type conversion (str(240 - charCount))

Controls - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465351.aspx

		] };

	Checkbox/radio buttons

	Dropdown combo

	Date/time

	Flip view

	Flyout (not really a control)

	Grid / VariableSizeWrapGrid (child elements have row/col properties)

		{ type: "grid", columns: [100, 100], rows: [50, 50], contents: [
		    { type: "text", value: "Somevalue", row: 1, column: 1 },
		] };

	GridView/ListView

	Hub
