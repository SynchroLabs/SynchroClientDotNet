Mobile Application As A Service (MAAAS)
==============================================

Nomenclature - 
    BoundItems -> ViewModelState

Processing view model changes on client:

    Rebinding to connect to new/changed data.  
	
	Maybe we should just always use the root and path to get the node (eliminating need to rebind).  
	   Check performance of SelectPath.
	   Investigate maintaining path/parentage on replaced tokens.
	   How do binding tokens ($root, $parent, etc) fit in to this?

	   If "resolved binding" (taking into consideration the binding context, which can include binding tokens) exists
	   at the time of initial binding, a valid path can be constructed.  If not, this binding would have to be 
	   re-attempted each time the client view model changes (from the server?) to see if the binding can then be
	   established.  Do we really need to support that (binding contexts that aren't available in the initial state)?

    Suspend change notification, update all changes, process bindings for all changes (look at path for each, for ancestor changes)

	For array bindings, update repeated items (remove all and re-add?), use stored template to create items (?)

Binding value types - value, array, or object (right now just value types)

Property binding expressions/directives:

	Negation using !, such as visibility="{!isVisible}"
	One time using ^

    Real expression support:

		Mathematical (240 - charCount)
		Logical (charCount >= 240)
		Type conversion (str(240 - charCount))

Controls - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465351.aspx

	AppBar/CommandBar and buttons (app bar button for round app bar buttons that can be used anywhere)

	Border

	Canvas (child elements have positioning properties)

		{ type: "canvas", contents: [
		    { type: "text", value: "Somevalue", top: 10, left: 25 },
		] };

	Checkbox/radio buttons

	Dropdown combo

	Date/time

	Flip view

	Flyout (not really a control)

	Grid / VariableSizeWrapGrid (child elements have row/col properties)

		{ type: "grid", columns: [100, 100], rows: [50, 50], contents: [
		    { type: "text", value: "Somevalue", row: 1, column: 1 },
		] };

	GridView/ListView

	Hub

	Media

	Progress bar / slider (both "range" controls with similar interface)

	Progress ring

	Semantic zoom

	Web view

	Windows contracts?  Sharing, settings, search...
