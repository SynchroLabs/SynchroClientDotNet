Mobile Application As A Service (MAAAS) - Client
=================================================


Controls - 

    !!! TODO - 

    WrapPanel (pretty much there)

        Win\WinPhone
		   - Item alignment (always top/left now)
        Android - FlowLayout 
		   - Needs margin-based layout
		   - Needs fixed size support
		   - Item alignment (gravity)?
        iOS -  UICollectionViewFlowLayout
		   - Needs fixed size support
		   - Items always aligned center (opposite orientation) and rows/cols justified (unless implement custom layout)

        All 
		   - Data bound "view" version would be nice...
		   - Auto-scrolling in overflow dimension (iOS does this now)

    Table (aka Grid, like HTML table, rows/colums, typically not data bound)

        Win/WinPhone - Grid
        Android - 
            TableLayout ?
            GridLayout - http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/11/new-layout-widgets-space-and-gridlayout.html
                Requires v11 (4.0/ICS) or v7 support library (does not distribute extra space)
        iOS - Ouch!

    GridView (flowing, scrolling grid) - Ideally support either data bound or explicit contents
        Win/WinPhone/Android - GridView
        iOS - UICollectionViewFlowLayout

        Attributes:
            item
            selectionItem

        Bindings:
            items
            selection
            onItemClick (command)

    !!! A GridView is really just a WrapPanel where every item is the same size.  Review use cases and functionality of platform
        controls and see if we can combine this into a single concept/implementation.



================================================================================

Margin/Padding layout stuff
------------------------------------

Win/WinPhone

    http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms751709(v=vs.110).aspx

    Margin - Supported on all elements via Margin property and Margin.Left/Right/Top/Bottom for setting individual values
    Padding - Only supported on certain elements (Block, Border, Control, Textblock)

    To add padding to StackPanel, we put a StackPanel inside of a Border - tested and working

Android

    http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html

    Padding - Supported by all elements (views) via PaddingLeft/PaddingRight/PaddingTop/PaddingBottom properties
    Margin - Supported in children of ViewGroup elements via ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams

    Margin and padding tested and working in StackPanel and Border

iOS

    Margin and padding tested and working in StackPanel and Border (implemented from scratch)

    !!! Padding for controls that support it natively via ContentInset/ContentEdgeInset?  Override padding properties in derived control wrappers?

Summary:

	Every control supports margin, and Border/StackPanel (at least) obey them
    Border and StackPanel support padding 


=======================

Text
    What if width unspecified or star, but control is still constrained horizontally at some width by parent, how do we detect/handle that (we don't right now)?

Client

    View/resource caching

Server

    Test on iPad, Kindle Fire

    Implement PropertyCross (more)

Misc

    Custom font names (platform-specific), weights (other than bold, per platform)?
