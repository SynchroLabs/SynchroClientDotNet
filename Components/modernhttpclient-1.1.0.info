Here\u0027s how it\nworks:\n\nOn iOS:\n\n```csharp\nvar httpClient = new HttpClient(new AFNetworkHandler());\n```\n\nOn Android:\n\n```csharp\nvar httpClient = new HttpClient(new OkHttpNetworkHandler());\n```\n\n","Version":"1.1.0","Summary":"Write your app using System.Net.Http, but drop this library in and it will go drastically faster.","QuickStart":"The good news is, you don\u0027t have to know either of these two libraries above, using ModernHttpClient is the most boring thing in the world.
